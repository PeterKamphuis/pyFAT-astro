id|distance|directoryname|cubename|basename
0|27|TheSingleGalaxyDirectory|TheNameoftheCubetobefitted(without .fits extension) |The basename and dir for Sofia products (Only important when start_point=3)
1|14|TheSecondGalaxyDirectory|TheNameoftheCubetobefitted(without .fits extension) |The basename and dir for Sofia products (Only important when start_point=3)

Preprocessed Sofia2 output can be anywhere the path is absolute or relative to directory name and will be copied to the directory Sofia_Output to avoid modifying the original products
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This means these products should not be in Sofia_Output with the basename+_FAT

Please note that Fat will always fit the brightest source in the sofia catalogue. The best way to make sure that the right object is fitted is to present a catalogue with a single object.
If the distance is -1 it will be inferred from the VSYS through a hubble flow. the minimum distance is 0.5 Mpc to avoid run away arguments
The header lines are important for FAT to recognize the correct column. Only their order can be changed.
